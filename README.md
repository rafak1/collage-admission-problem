# College admission problem

For n students, each with individual ranking of topics n â†’ s , assign them to i topics. Each topic needs to be occupied,
some with two persons. Which is a variation of a classic college admission problem (generalization of marriage problem).
But here you maximise your 'satisfaction' - how happy and fair is the group with the assignment. Can you cheat to get
your desired topic?
